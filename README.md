This is a simple web application that allows you to search and browse flags from different regions of the world. You can search for specific countries or filter flags by region. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

Search for flags: You can enter a country name in the search bar to find its corresponding flag. The search is case-insensitive and provides real-time results as you type.

Filter flags by region: You can select a region from the dropdown menu to filter flags based on that region. The available regions are Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.

Light mode: You can toggle between light and dark mode using the "Light Mode" button. This allows you to customize the appearance of the application according to your preference.
